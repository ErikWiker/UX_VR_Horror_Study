This contains the C# scripts and assets that was used to build a VR user study in Unity. 

The purpose of this study was to see if there was a correlation of fidelity/quality of the VR simulation and the 'presence' that was induced. To measure this, we used emotion (in this case, fear) to see how scared various users would get if the graphics/audio qualities were set at different levels. 
Each user in the experiment wore an Oculus Rift, a harness for the laptop running the program, and a heart rate monitor to later use to correlate with fear.
The experience was interacted with and the user tracked with motion capture elements, with the physical experimentation area being a large open space with many cameras and speakers to accurately represent the virtual location.

The study has been conducted, and the paper will be posted in GitHub main folder which includes more details and includes findings.
